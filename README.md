# Top Drivers of Bike Sharing Demand

Bike sharing system is a reality in many urban cities in the world and one of the biggest
concern is maintaining a reliable supply of bicycles to meet public demand regardless of time
and weather.

At this analysis I tried to build a highly interpretable model to predict bike demand as well as to understand the main attributes responsible for its fluctuation.
Below you can see my key findings, but if you are interested I also have a full report [here](./report/report.pdf).



The main objective of this analysis was to build a highly interpretative model where it is possible to isolate the principal
attributes that are mostly responsible for demand fluctuation. Although the interpretability I also avoided underfitting by simplicity.
